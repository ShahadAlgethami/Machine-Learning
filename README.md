# Telemarketing Campaign
 Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning Project using Rapid-Miner and Weka Softwar.

## Project Overview 
The increasing number of marketing campaigns over time cause reducing their effects on the public. So, to increase marketing campaign efficiency we build this project to get a dataset that acts as factors that affect the success of a campaign and predicting whether the campaign will be successful or not.
The objective is to build a KNN classifier that predicts whether a client will subscribe a term deposit. If the classifier has high accuracy, then banks can arrange a better management to improve their efficiency their profits.

This project aims to build a prediction about who will subscribe a term deposit based on dataset using K-Nearest Neighbor operator, and applied this algorithm on the dataset for 10,000 clients, 1 special attribute and 20 attributes using both Rapid Miner and Weka. Also, this algorithm will be applied again with two validation options (split & cross validation).

## K-Nearest Neighbor Method
We used k-nearest method as a classifier operator that generates a k-Nearest Neighbor model from the input dataset then classified the new value to binary classification (Yes, No) based on a similarity measure (distance functions) and classified by a majority vote of its neighbors. We chose this method because it helps in predicate the results of the target attribute, which the attribute can be classified as binary response.

## Bank Telemarketing Dataset
Bank telemarketing dataset contain 10,000 datasets that related with direct marketing which based on phone call. The goal of classification these data is to predict whether campaign will be successful to a certain client according on the dataset attributes.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@algethamishahad/most-common-programming-languages-used-in-united-states-ddd059f6a6cc?sk=7b03e2c1dac2bdc1b92fc617c8291174)
